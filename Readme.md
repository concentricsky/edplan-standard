# EdPlan standard
The EdPlan Standard is a data format used by institutions and vendors
to describe the Education Plans established by institutions and students
that map student journeys toward certificates and degrees.

EdPlan Standard is delivered as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site
that includes an OpenAPI 3.0 document. HTML content is compiled from Markdown.

## How to Contribute
Create a branch, make your modifications, and create a pull request back to the
`master` branch for review.

### Install and run locally
See [prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for running Jekyll
on your system. It is a Ruby tool, so you need a full Ruby development
environment set up. If you develop on more than one Ruby project, you may wish
to use a ruby environment manager like [RVM](https://rvm.io) or
[rbenv](http://rbenv.org/).

* Clone the repository to your file system
* Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `npm install`
* Run auto-reloading development server: `npm run start`
* Navigate browser to http://localhost:3000/ and watch as it magically reloads
when you make changes.
